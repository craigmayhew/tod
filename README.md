Test Only Development

Currently working:
0. This todo list is all there is.

Currently theory:
1. Produce syntactically valid units of code
2. Store them in an indexed structure, i.e. index them by arguements /int32/string/ in a directory?
3. Combine the unit into a new application.
4. Run bdd against the compiled program
5. Discard program or celebrate

6. Find a way to intelligently splice/combine applications.
7. Refine how available choices are made: What functions to use, how to combine them, what prgrams to splice.

See https://github.com/craigmayhew/tod/tree/beta for the rust based beta version for producing programs from functions to meet behat tests.

See https://github.com/craigmayhew/tod/tree/alpha for the php based alpha version for producing functions to meet a unit test.
